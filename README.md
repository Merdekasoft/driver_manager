Driver Manager
A Qt-based GUI for Managing Drivers on Debian-based Systems
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for managing hardware drivers on Debian-based Linux distributions. Built with Python and PySide6, this application helps users easily identify, install, and remove drivers, especially for graphics, network, and audio devices.

Features
Hardware Detection: Automatically detects your system's hardware and recommends relevant drivers.

Driver Categories: Organizes drivers into categories like Graphics, Network, Audio, Printing, and more.

Install/Remove Drivers: Provides a straightforward way to install and remove packages using apt-get.

Status Indicators: Shows which drivers are currently installed and which are recommended for your system.

Technologies Used
Python 3: The core programming language for the application.

PySide6 (Qt for Python): Used for building the graphical user interface.

python-apt: A Python interface for the apt package management system.

Installation
This application is designed for Debian-based systems. You need to have Python 3 and PySide6 installed.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd driver-manager
Install dependencies:
This project requires PySide6 and the python-apt library.

Bash

# Install PySide6
pip install PySide6

# Install python-apt
sudo apt-get install python3-apt
Usage
Since this application manages system drivers, it requires root privileges to run.

Run the application with sudo:

Bash

sudo python3 main.py
The GUI will launch, allowing you to browse driver categories, view available drivers, and install or remove them.
